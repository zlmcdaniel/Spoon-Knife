I think a possible project could be a club organization app, where you can schedule meetings and give tasks to people all within an app.Another idea could be to make something for RPI students to be able to make friends virtually so they can still get to know people even though there aren't many events happening.The projects could be done with a common repository but have many branches for the different parts of it. Then when a task is done it can be merged with the master branch.
